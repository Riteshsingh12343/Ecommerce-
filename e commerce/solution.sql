-- Text instructions: 
-- *Load large CSV files into MySQL Database faster using Command line prompt
-- 1. Open MySQL Workbench, Create a new database to store the tables you'll import (eg- FacilitySerivces).
-- Then, Create the table with matching data types of csv file, usually with INT and CHAR datatypes only (without the data) in the database you just created using Workbench.
-- 2. Open the terminal or command line prompt (Go to windows, search for cmd.exe. Shortcut - Windows button + R, then type cmd)
-- 3. We'll now connect with MySQL database in command line prompt. Follow the steps below:
-- Copy the path of your MySQL bin directory in your computer. (Normally it is under c drive program files).
-- The bin directory of MySQL Server is generally in this path - C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
-- Now, in the Command Line prompt, type 


-- cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin 


-- and press enter.


-- 4. Connect to the MySQL database using the following command in command line prompt


-- mysql -u root -p


-- (please replace "root" with your user name that you must have configured while installing MySQL server)
-- (press enter, it will ask for the password, give your password)


-- 5. If you are successfully logged to mysql,
-- then set the global variables by using below command so that data can be imported from local computer folder.


-- mysql> SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;


-- Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
-- (you've just instructed MySQL server to allow local file upload from your computer)


-- 6. Quit current server connection:
-- mysql> quit
-- Bye


-- 7. Load the file from CSV file to the MySQL database. In order to do this, please follow the commands:
-- (We'll connect with the MySQL server again with the local-infile system variable. 
-- This basically means you want to upload data into a database table from your local machine)


-- mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
-- (give password)


-- - Show Databases;
-- (It'll show all the databases in MySQL server.)


-- - mysql> USE fs_db2;
-- (makes the database that you had created in step 1 as default schema to use for the next sql scripts)
-- (Use your Database and load the file into the table.


-- The next step is to load the data from local case study folder into the transactionmaster table in fs_db2 database)


-- mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:\\_Ivy Professional School\\_Data Analytics\\Course Design\\SQL - RDBMS\\Share With Students\\SQL Case Studies\\SQL Case Study\\SQL Case 3\\Case 3 - Facility Services SQL - Data & Qns\\transactionmaster.csv'
-- INTO TABLE TransactionMaster
-- FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
-- ENCLOSED BY '"'
-- LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;


-- *VERY IMP - Please replace single backward (\) slash in the path with double back slashes (\\) instead of single slash*
-- Also note that "transactionmaster" is my table name, use the table name that you've given while creating the database in step 1.


-- 8. Now check if data has been imported or not.


-- SELECT * FROM transactionmaster LIMIT 20;


-- 9. If data has been imported successfully with 100% accuracy without error,
-- then alter the table to update the datatypes (if needed) of some columns, etc. You're all set now.
